SMASH is a HTML5 game built with [phaser](www.phaser.io) framework following the tutorial form [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_breakout_game_Phaser) and a little bit of imagination.

I built this game as a personal project while Learning game development in HTML5 following the basic tutorials from MDN where I was introduced to Phaser framework.
